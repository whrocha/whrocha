# :rocket: DATA ENGINEERING ROCKS!

## Hello Everyone !

I believe Data is now part of a much bigger process when we think about competition. It is not simply about managing data or a
pipeline. It is about creating environments that give us an edge. "Big Data" per se, is what started this whole process. It is
when technology decided to expand how much insights it has available to produce, comprehend, or react to consumer behavior.

Built reliable and maintainable data pipeline that always seek to do what is the best data engineering approach, this is what I have been doing as a Data Engineer.

**Talk Data with me, and let's change the world using DATA!**
